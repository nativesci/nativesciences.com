<p>This open access online journal gives preference to publishing high impact articles written by Native Americans, Alaska Natives 
and other Indigenous peoples. We also publish infographics, maps, and other forms of media. The goal 
of this journal is to provide a place where individuals can share, access information, and humbly offer strategies 
for issues facing Native, Indigenous, Aborigine, American Indian, and First Nations peoples.</p>

<b>The Palouse Prairie, A Vanishing Indigenous Peoples Garden</b> by Cleve Davis, 2 February 2019</p>

<p><blockquote><i><b>Abstract</b></i> Native biodiversity has countless benefits to all peoples, but 
probably no more so than the people 
of Indigenous societies. However, with global biodiversity declining at unprecedented rates the loss 
is contributing to the erosion of Indigenous cultures, languages, and health. One place, where 
biodiversity decline has occurred at an excessive level is the Palouse prairie in the Pacific northwest. 
Prior to contact with Euro-Americans, the Palouse prairie was once a vast garden for Indigenous 
peoples. Although Indigenous peoples have relied upon the biodiversity of the Palouse for millennia, 
very little of the natural prairie remains. The purpose of this study was to quantify what remains 
of the garden (prairie) and to assess the abundance of culturally important native plants. Using 
remote sensing, it was found that only 1.7% of the garden remains within the region. Analysis of 
plot-based data revealed the frequency of food, medicinal, and other beneficial native plants 
is low. Steps should be taken to preserve the genetic diversity of the region before threats eliminate
 important native plant species. Establishment and tending to natural gardens, legal protection of 
prairie, and incentives to landowners to conserve prairie on private lands may help reduce the 
decline of native plant biodiversity.</blockquote>

<H4>Best Practices on Publication Ethics</H4>
<p>The aim of this journal is to create hope and positive change in the lives of Native peoples, inform and encourage 
discussion. Therefore, the following guidelines have been established. All papers must be based upon truthful 
information, which includes what is known as Native Science and Traditional Ecological Knowledge. In this spirit, 
the review process may require researchers to submit their information sources and data. We also have limited capacity 
to publish data, and if you are interested in publishing your data here let us know. As we strive for transparency, 
all funding source used to support the research must be identified on all submissions. The list of authors should 
also reflect those who contributed significant information towards the research. In other words, if your research 
involved work with Native peoples you should carefully consider how you are going to acknowledge these individuals, 
and whether they want to be acknowledged or not, well before conducting the research.</p>
