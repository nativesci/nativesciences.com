<h3>Submit Article</h3>
<p>We publish under four tracks, which include: Native Sciences Research, Insight (including Spiritual), 
Personal Experience, and Perspectives (opinion). Authors need to identify which track they wish to be 
published under, when submitting the article. All manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Native Sciences 
must be written from the "heart" and address issues that greatly affect the lives of Indigenous peoples. 
When developing your article, you should suggest a strategy or method that will have an impact on policy, 
law, social justice, and/or marginalization. Authors should also be mindful of the needs of others, 
including the four legged, finned, that which grows, the feathered, water, and mother earth.

<h4>Native Sciences Research Track</h4>
<p>For scientific research papers, the manuscript must include the following sections: Title, Name of Author(s),
 Abstract, Key Words, Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Giving Back, and Acknowledgment.
 Authors should also supply a biosketch of themselves (no more than 3 lines), the biosketch should identify what 
 Indigenous Nation you belong (if applicable). The purpose of the section "Giving Back", to identify things 
 of value that can be given back to Indigenous peoples. For example, the research may have produce data or 
 products that may be of value to Indigenous peoples. Acknowledgements should identify individuals who contributed
 to the research and must identify any funding source used to complete the research. Native Sciences Journal 
 may charge a fee for publications supported by outside parties (e.g., National Science Foundation).Abstracts 
 should be no more than 200 words and italicized. You should also supply up to seven key words that are 
 representative of the manuscript. Key words should be bolded. Papers submitted under this track should be 
 between 4,000 and 8,000 words, not including citations.</p>

<h4>Insight (including spiritual), Personal Experience, and Perspective (Opinion) Tracks</h4>
<p>Format of manuscripts submitted under these tracks is at the authors discretion, but manuscript under these 
tracks must identify a purpose and have a stated outcome or significance to Indigenous people. For example, 
personal experiences should be related to some social issue personally experienced that results in 
marginalization or is relevant to a larger group of Indigenous people. They can also be warnings, 
teachings, and predictions. This is also true with spiritual insights and teachings. Under these tracks
 we suggest articles be written as a news article for the lay person and include a lot of photographs.</p>


<h3>Writing Guidance</h3>
<p>
In general, the Native Sciences Journal follows the Chicago Style, and it is recommended that authors 
use Microsoft Office's Chicago Style for footnotes, citations in text, and reference citations. Otherwise 
we recommend the authors review: A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations Chicago
 Style for Students and Researcher by Kate L. Turabian, and the Chicago Manual of Style by the University 
 of Chicago Press. Authors should also follow the guidance below. When in doubt, refer to the recommended books.

All manuscripts should be single spaced and use Times New Roman Font. Font size 11 should be used for 
the text of the body. Justify the body of the text. Headers should be no larger than size 16 and margins 
set to 1" on all sides. Authors must identify which track they plan to submit the article under, contact 
information, and a brief statement why the manuscript is important to Indigenous peoples. This information
should be provided in a separate cover letter or part of the email accompanying manuscript.</p>


<H3>Book Publishing</H3>
<p>We are aspiring to be a source for book publication, especially books written by Indigenous peoples. 
Please contact the <a href="mailto:editor@nativesciences.com">Editor</a> to discuss book publishing potential
and what JNS may be able to offer.</p>

<h4>Citations in Text</h4>
<p>The last name of the author should be provided first followed by the year of publication. Page number(s) 
must also be identified after year and separated by a comma. <blockquote>Example: An untold number of prairie plants were 
gathered by women, and the efforts of women were a necessity to maintaining tribal health and wellbeing (Hunn 1990, 
37, Scheuerman and Finely 2008, 27, Davis, et al. 2015, 57-58)</blockquote></p>

<H4>Measurements</H4>
<p>Measurements can be in either the metric or English system. Authors should carefully consider who is the intended 
audience of the manuscript and what measurement system will they understand best. For example, in the United States 
most Native Americans are familiar with the English system of measurements (e.g., acres, feet, etc.) better than the 
metric system. If the intended audience includes Native Americans from the United States it is recommended that 
authors use the English system.</p>

<H4>Scientific Names</H4>
<p>When referring to an organism the common name should be used first followed by the scientific name. For example, 
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). It is not necessary to provide the authority of scientific names.</p>

<H4>Figures, Tables, Photographs, and Art</H4>
<p>Figures and tables should be placed near the text where they are introduced and centered. The caption of figures 
should be below the figure and above tables. Descriptions of figures, tables, photographs, and art should all be 
centered and provide enough information to stand alone. Figures can be either black and white or color, and must 
be saved at high resolution. Text used in figures must be legible. The font of figures and tables must be in 
italics. The column header of tables should be bold and repeated, if table spans multiple pages.

It is the responsibility of the author gain permission to use photographs and art as part of the publication process. 
Preferrably the author should only use photographs in which they have written permission to use. In other words, 
make sure the people in your photograph give you consent to use their image. We do encourage the use of photographs 
and art, especially on the cover. All photographs and art must give credit to creator, or copyright holder. 
Journal editors may require more information on credits used as part of submission review process.</p>

<H4>Use of Indigenous Language Words</H4>
<p>When using Indigenous words, the text should be in italics. We do invite articles written in the heritage language of the author(s). 
Articles written in an Indigenous language must follow an established orthography, which must also be submitted with the 
English version of the article.</p>

<h4>Use of Acronyms</h4>
Acronyms should not be used in the abstract and spelled out when first used in the body narrative.
